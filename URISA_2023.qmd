## Center On Rural Innovation (CORI)

> Advancing economic prosperity in rural America though the creation of inclusive tech economy ecosystem that support scalable entrepreneurship and tech job creation

(should we use the "burrito" / I also like the def in rural tech workforce)

::: aside
Learn more at: <https://ruralinnovation.us/>
:::

::: notes
@drew I swapped our presentation for "flow" concerns it makes more sense to move from CORI -\> to goal of presentation than cori -\> us -\> goal of presentation

Where does Broadband stand in CORI goals Here the focus is Broadband is an ingredient of tech ecosystem
:::

## Intro to problem/work

-   The so "what".
-   Examples of funding associated with these datasets (annual BB funding)
-   Discord channel \<- as a good ressources (or maybe the webinar of bb team?)

Rural def need to be here also

FCC staff estimation pop go here

Interested in our works on the impact of rural definitions? [here!](https://ruralinnovation.us/blog/defining-rural-america/)

::: notes
@drew FCC staff are maybe not perfect but at least they are documentation and codes about it, unlike NBM

## Historical context and new data context (1)

-   [Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/): FCC

-   [Form 477](https://www.fcc.gov/economics-analytics/industry-analysis-division/form-477-resources): f477

-   [National Broadband Map](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home): NBM


|                   | f477             | NBM              |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| US Census         | 2010             | 2020             |
| Type of recording | self declarative | self declarative |
| Granularity       | Census block     | Locations        |
| Services          | Mobile/**Fixed**     | Mobile/**Fixed**     |

## Historical context and new data context (2)

Unserved: less than 25 MBps downloads and 3 MBps uploads 

Underseved: less than 100 Mbps downloads and 20 uploads

f477: at least one rule

With NBM we can know that at the location level. 

BEAD definitions for Unserved block is if more than 80% of locations are Unserved. 

-   Challenges

-   Two releases per years (but multiple versions of one release, )

::: aside
(link/quotes to def. or pages)
:::

::: notes
some BB defs here
should we add an iframe of some FCC NBM localisation? 

at least one rule: if one ISP said he was present with 25/3 in a census block then all location in that block was "Served"

## Results general overview (1)

Diff between f477 and bdm:
  *  Improvement for 100_20 and fiber. 
  *  But not for “25_3” / Unserved / Not reported.

## 3    f477         1.50     Unserved

## Results Rural Areas underestimated in statitics  (2a)

Here we look at the 20% threshold discussed previously 

Proportion of population covered (at least one 25/3) that is rural is 15.91% (rest is urban)

Proportion of population "served" (at least 20%, 25/3) that is rural is 52,26% 

Proportion of population "Unserved" (less than 20%, 25/3) that is rural is 25.63%

## Results Rural Areas underestimated in statitics  (2b)

![unserved_rural_not.png](img/unserved_rural_not.png)

- Self declarative data set (FCC (CostQuest) provided the locations): effect on rural -> less interest to works here -> less interest to report on here? 

::: notes
unsure if "underestimated" is the correct word
source NBM FCC staff for pop

## Rural Overrepresented in poor broadband! (3)

Observation about f477 -> NBM in US is similar in rural but "amplifed"

Rural has a worth bb access:
  * more Not Reported / Unserved. 
  * less coverage, especialy fiber. 


```{r}
cat("##    source pct_coverage         type
## 1    f477         1.84 Not reported
## 2     nbm         1.55 Not reported
## 3    f477         5.26     Unserved
## 4     nbm         9.14     Unserved
## 5    f477        92.90         25_3
## 6     nbm        90.86         25_3
## 7     nbm        76.99      25_3 .2
## 8     mbm        83.61      25_3 .5
## 9    f477        77.40       100_20
## 10    nbm        83.95       100_20
## 11   f477        28.12    Has_fiber
## 12    nbm        41.70    Has_fiber")
```

## Conclusion

Overall great improvement in data quality and better understanding on what is happening on the ground (is it enough?)

Rural areas appears to have lower broadband access

Rural areas are systematically underestimated by data definitions:
  - at least one rule (see def f477 -> bdm for rural)
  - 20% rules
  * what are we measuring an improvement on coverage or an improvement on data quality?


::: notes
@drew even if we use the tabulate 2010 2020 we will face some issues: where are the locations in % covered of x 2020 or y 2020 block
:::

## Next steps

- Providing a reproducible way for other to explore FCC data at scale (moving our codes to public)
- People moves / covid
-   Upcoming FCC updates.
-   Fabric data (article you do not need fabric ?) (instead of using census block 2010 we could use locations )
- API ? 

## Questions?

Thanks for your attention!
