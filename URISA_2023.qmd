## Center On Rural Innovation (CORI)

> Advancing economic prosperity in rural America though the creation of inclusive tech economy ecosystem that support scalable entrepreneurship and tech job creation

(should we use the "burrito" / I also like the def in rural tech workforce)

::: aside
Learn more at: [https://ruralinnovation.us/](https://ruralinnovation.us/)
:::

::: notes
@drew I swapped our pressentation for "flow" concerns it makes more sense to move from CORI -\> to goal of presentation than cori -\> us -\> goal of presentation

Where does Broadband stand in CORI goals
Here the focus is Broadband is an ingredient of tech ecosystem
:::

## Intro to problem/work

-   The so "what".
-   Examples of funding associated with these datasets (annual BB funding)
-   Discord channel \<- as a good ressources (or maybe the webinar of bb team?)

Rural def need to be here also

## Historical context and new data context (1)

-   [Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/): FCC

-   [Form 477](https://www.fcc.gov/economics-analytics/industry-analysis-division/form-477-resources): f477

-   [National Broadband Map](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home): NBM

Mobile and fixed (both)

|                   | f477             | NBM              |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| US Census         | 2010             | 2020             |
| Type of recording | declarativ (ISP) | declarativ (ISP) |
| grain             | Census block     |                  |

## Historical context and new data context (2)

We need to specify some BB def here

-   Fabric data (article you do not need fabric ?)
-   challenges

## Workflow: From FCC to our products

    A1[FCC Website] --> B1[Server]
    A2[TIGER Census block] --> C2

TODO: clean repo -\> move that to "what next"

::: aside
Tools used:
Shell (Bash) with GNU tools (make, csvkit, sed) / SQL (PostgreSQL/PostGIS) / A bit of R (ease some processes)
:::

## Results general overview (1)

-   New data implication differences\*\*\*
-   Numbers and tables of differences

::: notes
need better name (2-3 slides 9 min)
:::

## Rural overrepresented in poor broadband! (2)

here rural stuff

## Results Data quality (3)

could be first

## Conclusion/

-   Upcoming FCC updates.
-   Possible recommendations

## Next steps

-   Providing a reproducible way for other to explore FCC data at scale (moving our codes to public)

## Questions?

Thanks for your attention!
